# coffeebot
An automated coffee order retrieval application using the Slack API

*NOTE:* Workspace/Bot OAuth access tokens cannot appear in public GitHub repos
In the future, the application's token will be pulled from a file 
located outside of this repo. Make sure your workspace/bot token is in a file
on your filesystem and the file path is specified. Tokens are generated
from the Slack API page for your application, for example:
